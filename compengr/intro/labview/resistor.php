Because we are dealing with integers only, the type of these three ring menus can remain the default.  The first band is multiplied by 10 to make it the tens place.  This is then added to the second band&apos;s value. The resultant is multiplied by <span class="math">10<sup><i>Band 3</i></sup></span>, which gives the resistors value in ohms.
